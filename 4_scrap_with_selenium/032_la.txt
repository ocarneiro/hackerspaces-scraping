Want to stop by?

NSL has an “Open Door” policy. If we’re open, you’re welcome to stop by! We’re always open on Tuesday night from 19:00 – 01:00 (we often close much later). If you’re new we recommend stopping by on a Tuesday; most members and keyholders stop by on Tuesdays. We hold classes every Saturday. We’re open on other weekdays, too, but make sure to check this website (top left corner) or check IRC/call the phone to verify we’ll be around when you arrive.
On this website you will see a sign that says that we are Open or Closed. This is reading from a sensor connected to the front door of NSL. If it says open – the door is definitely open! With that in mind, it’s a good idea to hop into the IRC channel (Efnet #NSL) and do a sanity check. You never know how many people are at the space or how soon they will be leaving if you don’t ask!
You can also give us a call when you are nearby to verify someone is still there using our phone number: +1-213-232-1332
Having trouble finding us or getting inside the space? Check out a detailed photo guide or visit our about page.
